# Work in progress #

## Todo: ##
- Add better prompting (system and user)
- Add tool call for blackboard entries
- Set up fixed iteration looping (e.g. n = 5)

## Questions: ##
- What is an effective termination condition? Voting on confidence, meta-moderator, fixed rounds?
- How can we improve communication methods? Currently using tags but hierarchical blackboard might make scoping problems easier
- How do we determine triggering order? Hierarchical might be useful here as well
- Can we add different prompts/capabilities to our agents?

## Setup: ##
- Create .env file and add GEMINI_API_KEY from Google AI Studio
